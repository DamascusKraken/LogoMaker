# LogoMaker  

## Description  

AS a freelance web developer
I WANT to generate a simple logo for my projects
SO THAT I don't have to pay a graphic designer

Building this application does not only cut out extra expenses but saves on time.
I learned how to work with diffrenet SVG shapes. 
Working with node to write files has become more fluid and increased my understanding.
